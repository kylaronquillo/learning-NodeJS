# Learning Node.js - Basic Informational Site

## Project: Basic Informational Site

1. Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `about.html`
   - `contact-me.html`
   - `404.html`

2. Create your Node.js server file `index.js` and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the URL.
   - `localhost:8080` should take users to `index.html`
   - `localhost:8080/about` should take users to `about.html`
   - `localhost:8080/contact-me` should take users to `contact-me.html`
   - `404.html` should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
